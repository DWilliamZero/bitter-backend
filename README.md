# Bitter - A Twitter Parody website

## Description:
Bitter is a clone/parody of twitter.  Users can create an account, login, post/delete "bits", comment on other people's beets, and follow/unfollow other users. Bitter is built using a React frontend, and a Ruby on Rails backend.  Bitter also employs firebase cloud storage for picture, and Active Mailer for email notifications.  The Frontend is deployed to Surge, and the backend is deployed on Heroku.
